Given I am on the bing.com homepage
When I click on the copilot icon in the browser sidebar
And I type "How does Prowly media monitoring module compare with other similar tools?" in the chat box
And I press enter
Then I should see a response from copilot with a comparison table or chart
And I should see links to [Prowly media monitoring website](https://prowly.com/media-monitoring/) and other relevant sources for more information
