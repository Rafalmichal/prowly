Given I am on the bing.com homepage
When I click on the copilot icon in the browser sidebar
And I type "What are the features of Prowly media monitoring module?" in the chat box
And I press enter
Then I should see a response from copilot with a summary of the features
And I should see a link to [Prowly media monitoring website](https://prowly.com/media-monitoring/) for more details
